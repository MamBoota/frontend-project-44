## First project in Hexlet platform.

"Brain Games" - a set of five cantilever games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for pumping the brain. Each game asks questions to which you need to give the correct answers. After three correct answers, it is believed that the game is completed. The wrong answers complete the game and offer to go again. Games:

- brain-even - Determination of even number.
- brain-calc - Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated.
- brain-gcd - Determination of the greatest common divider.
- brain-progression - Search for missed numbers in the sequence of numbers.
- brain-prime - Determination of a simple number.
